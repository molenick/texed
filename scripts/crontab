# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# For example, the entry below runs cron.php every day at 2pm.
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 14 * * * php PATH_TO_INSTALL/includes/cron.php
